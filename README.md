NAME
----

`journal.py` - a command line tool for viewing and maintaining a journal

DESCRIPTION
-----------

`journal.py` is a tool to archive, search through, calculate statistics
on, verify, and create tags for a plain text journal. It expects journal
files to have the extension `.journal` and the contents to conform to a
(loose) syntax. Entries start with unindented dates in the form `YYYY-MM-DD`,
optionally followed by "`, WEEKDAY`" (without quotes).  Entry contents
starts on the next line, indented by at least one tab.  Each line is a
paragraph; consequtive lines must either be indented by the same level,
by one more level, or by arbritrarily fewer levels (down to one) than
the previous line. An empty line is required between entries.  For
example:

    2012-03-29, Thursday
        This is the first paragraph.
        This is the second paragraph.
            Lines can be indented one level further
                for each line,
        but can drop back arbitrarily far
    
    2012-03-30, Friday
        The next entry.
