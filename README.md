NAME
----

`journal.py` - a command line tool for viewing and maintaining a journal

DESCRIPTION
-----------

`journal.py` is a tool to archive, search through, calculate statistics on,
verify, and create tags for a plain text journal. It expects journal files to
have the extension `.journal` and the contents to conform to a (loose) syntax.
Entries start with unindented dates in the form `YYYY-MM-DD`, optionally
followed by `, WEEKDAY`. Entry contents begins on the next line, one paragraph
per line, each indented by at least one tab. Consecutive lines must either be
indented by the same level, by one more level, or by arbitrarily fewer levels
(down to one) than the previous line. An empty line is required between entries.

For example:

    1970-01-01, Thursday
        This is the first paragraph.
        This is the second paragraph.
			An indented third paragraph.
				A further-intended fourth paragraph.
		An unindented fifth paragraph.
    
    1970-01-02, Friday
        The next entry.
